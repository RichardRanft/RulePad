RulePad
=======

A C# tool for extracting tables from RTF files and generating TorqueScript arrays from them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the moment the tool emits an MIT license block and then the d20 Open Game License block.  I plan to add a way to specify license files that will be included as headers instead of the hard-coded solution present now.
